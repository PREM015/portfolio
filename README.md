## 🔥 Design Philosophy

* **Minimal yet expressive** — Black base with soft gradients and white glowing text.
* **Accessible animations** — Everything flows smoothly without hurting performance.
* **Responsive everywhere** — Mobile to large screens.
* **Fully modular** — Built component-by-component with reusability in mind.
